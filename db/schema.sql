create table if not exists public.announcements (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  image_url text not null,
  title text default 'Untitled Announcement',
  display_duration integer default 10,
  transition_type text default 'fade',
  active boolean default true
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table public.announcements enable row level security;

-- 3. Create RLS Policies for the Table
-- Cleanup old policies to ensure idempotency
drop policy if exists "Public Annoucements are viewable by everyone" on public.announcements;
drop policy if exists "Anyone can upload announcements" on public.announcements;
drop policy if exists "Anyone can update announcements" on public.announcements;
drop policy if exists "Anyone can delete announcements" on public.announcements;

-- PUBLIC VIEW
create policy "Public Annoucements are viewable by everyone"
on public.announcements for select
to public
using ( true );

-- PUBLIC EDIT (Insert/Update/Delete) - logic for Admin Panel w/o Auth
create policy "Anyone can upload announcements"
on public.announcements for insert
to public
with check ( true );

create policy "Anyone can update announcements"
on public.announcements for update
to public
using ( true );

create policy "Anyone can delete announcements"
on public.announcements for delete
to public
using ( true );

-- 4. Create the Settings Table
create table if not exists public.settings (
  id integer primary key default 1,
  refresh_interval integer default 5, -- in minutes
  default_duration integer default 10, -- in seconds
  constraint single_row check (id = 1)
);

alter table public.settings enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "Public Settings are viewable by everyone" on public.settings;
drop policy if exists "Anyone can update settings" on public.settings;

create policy "Public Settings are viewable by everyone"
on public.settings for select
to public
using ( true );

create policy "Anyone can update settings"
on public.settings for update
to public
using ( true );

insert into public.settings (id, refresh_interval, default_duration)
values (1, 5, 10)
on conflict (id) do nothing;

-- 5. Create the Storage Bucket
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('announcements', 'announcements', true)
on conflict (id) do update
set public = true; 

-- 6. Storage Policies
drop policy if exists "Public Access" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Public Upload" on storage.objects;

create policy "Public Access"
on storage.objects for select
to public
using ( bucket_id = 'announcements' );

create policy "Public Upload"
on storage.objects for insert
to public
with check ( bucket_id = 'announcements' );
